"content":"<p>Mike is home for a 2-week well-deserved break in training. Summer training is over, and now he is looking ahead to the winter competition season.</p><p>This summer Mike exceeded all of his and his coach's goals. He qualified full double-full this summer, one jump beyond the full-full that he was expected to qualify. He passed trampoline routine 3 and will pass trampoline routine 4 in the next month. And he passed physical testing, which involved endurance and strength, and many extra hours of gym time. As he used to tell people when he was only a little kid \"I have the body fat of an Olympic athlete\"; and now it's true!</p><p>Mike started online high school in September, and has stuck to his personal goal of school work every day except for Sunday. He is progressing along with great grades and no help from his parents.</p><p>This winter Mike will be competing in 10 NorAm events as well as the Junior Olympics in Steamboat Springs, CO, and the Nationals in Stratton, VT.</p><p>He is currently ranked 45th in the world in men's aerials, and we fully expect his national and world positions to improve as he competes with his higher degree of difficulty jumps.</p><p>Having lived with and trained with Olympians for the last 4 months, Mike has become increasingly dedicated to his sport, to the extent of building a chin-up bar at home to continue his strength training while he's home. He is taking full responsibility for all of his decisions and performance, which we think is tremendous for a 16 year old.</p><p>We hope you join us in wishing him well in winter competitions, staying strong, and continuing his upward rise in men's aerials.</p>"}
