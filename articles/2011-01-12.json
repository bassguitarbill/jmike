"content":"<p>Well, as you know by now, Mike has gotten off to a very successful start for the winterï¿½season, winning a bronze medal at his second competition in Apex, BC on Dec 20.</p><p>But what you probably don't know, is that Mike's 3rd place finish got him an invitation to be on the US Ski Team World Cup group. Mike will be competing in his first World Cup at Lake Placid on January 21! This is quite an acheivement for him, considering it was exactly 3 years ago that Bill, Mike and I watched our first aerials World Cup at Lake Placid, and were thinking about moving him out to Park City. We are really excited about this - the World Cup is the highest level of competition on non-Olympic years.</p><p>In addition, Mike moved up on the USSA points list. He is now ranked 7th in the US in Men's Aerials! Go Jersey Mike!</p><p>Mike had a great 12 days off in NJ over Christmas break, returning to Lake Placid on January 2. The team drove up to Mt Gabriel, Quebec on January 4, to train for the two NorAm competitions held on January 8th and 9th. Bill and I drove up on January 7 to root him on, and we weren't disappointed.</p><p>The NorAms at Mt Gabriel are held a week before the Mt Gabriel World Cup, so the entire US team, Canada, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Japanese national teams were all there, and they use the NorAms as a warm-up event. In other words, Mike didn't have a chance of getting a medal.</p><p>But he did great! He came in 8th at the first comp and 11th at the second comp, out of 38 men competing. In each event, he came in 2nd out of all of the US jumpers, including the US National team! He beat every one of the US men except for Dylan Ferguson. He stomped his landings, and got his highest scores for his career so far!</p><p>Mike is at the top of his game, working hard and competing great! Bill and I are really looking forward to seeing him compete at the World Cup in Lake Placid. For those of you who can't join us, perhaps you can catch it on TV! Here are the listings:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.usskiteam.com/freestyle/events/event?eventId=1019\">Nature Valley Freestyle Cup</a>: NBC,1/29/2011 at 2PM and Versus, 1/30/2011 at 2PM</p><p>Mike's not going to make the finals, so he probably will not be shown or mentioned, but it should be good TV anyway!</p><p>Thank you for all of your support!</p>"}
