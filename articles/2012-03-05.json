"content":"<p>Hey, Jersey fans!</p><p>Before the season ends, I would like to update everyone on Mike's progress.  He is having a great winter!</p><p>Mike's goal this winter was to train and land his first triples on snow.  He competed in two World Cups at Lake Placid, finishing on the first day with a very respectable 16<sup>th</sup> place out of 32 athletes.  Then he traveled to Park City to compete at the Deer Valley World Cup.</p><p>Mike's goal of landing triples propelled him into finishing in 2<sup>nd</sup> place overall in the NorAm Cup tour!  The most memorable day of the tour was when the entire Rossi clan west of the Mississippi gathered to watch him win gold on February 9 at the Utah Olympic Park.  Mike finished up with 2 golds and 1 silver for the NorAm tour, landing his first season's triples!</p><p>The most exciting news to date is that Mike has been invited to compete for the US at the Junior World Championships, to be held in Valmalenco, Italy on March 21.  The last time there was an aerial event at the Junior Worlds was in 2006, so this is a once-in-a-lifetime competition opportunity for Mike.  He is traveling to Milan on March 17 with a team of 8 young men and women, representing the United States.  The same team is returning home on March 22 to jump in the US Nationals on March 24, which ends their season.</p><p>Go Jersey Mike!</p>"}
