"content":"<p>We just got back from Mike's first World Cup competition at Lake Placid.  What a blast!  Having been to a few World Cups before, it's a whole different experience when your son is competing!</p><p>First of all, Mike looked incredible in his US Ski Team uniform!  Check out his official website for new pics: <a href=\"http://www.jerseymikeaerials.com/photos.html\">www.jerseymikeaerials.com</a></p><p>Mike was invited to compete in this World Cup because of his great performance at the Selections NorAm in Apex.  It was mainly a comp for Mike to have the experience of competing in a World Cup, but he knew he wouldn't be competative with the best jumpers in the world.  Mike only performs doubles, and the national team jumpers are older and jumping triples.</p><p>However, he placed 22nd out of a field of 36 competitors from 10 countries, and 4th out of the 8 US men.  His full double-full earned him a career high 91.65 points, so Mike truly performed at his peak.  And he had a blast, performing air guitar on his ski for the TV cameras after his jump!</p><p>Remember, this event will be on NBC Jan 29, 2pm.</p><p>Next stop, Calgary and the next NorAm events.  Go Jersey Mike!</p>"}
