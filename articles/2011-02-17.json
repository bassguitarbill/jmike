"content":"<p>This has been a tremendously exciting month for all of us!</p><p>Mike, Bill and I just got back home from a week in Park City, where Mike had 2 NorAm competitions.  He won the first event, and placed 2nd by only .26 points in the second event.  Tracie, Lou, Amanda, John and Lisa were all at the jump site to cheer Mike on as he stood on the NorAm podium.</p><p>Before they fly to Park City, Mike's team traveled to Calgary, Canada for a week, to compete in the Calgary NorAms.  Mike earned a 2<sup>nd</sup> place medal at the Calgary NorAm on February 5, and finished in 6th place at the Feb 6 competition in Calgary.</p><p>The combination of his finishes in the last 4 events have him in the lead for the NorAm Cup, the overall winner of the NorAm series of competitions!  The NorAms are one step below the World Cup.</p><p>After talking with Mike's coach, Bergy, we decided that Mike should head up to Val St. C&ocirc;me, Quebec, next week to compete in the last 2 NorAm events.  This was a big change of plans, because the rest of Mike's team is remaining in Park City to train, and then heading to the Junior Nationals in Steamboat Springs, CO.  However, winning the NorAm cup is much more important than winning the Junior Nationals.  We have also been told by Bergy that Mike has gotten the scores he needed this season to be nominated to the US Ski Team this spring.</p><p>So, all in all, a great month for Mike and his career!</p><p>Mike's photo with Ashley Caldwell was included in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/sports/skiing/14aerials.html?_r=2&pagewanted=2\">New York Times from Feb 14, 2011</a>.</p><p>Go Jersey Mike!</p>"}
