"content":"<p>Just to recap, this summer Mike was asked to join the Elite aerials team, the development team for the US ski team. We moved Mike up to Lake Placid NY the end of June.  During training this summer, he worked on some new tricks, and by the end of summer was throwing full full and full double full.  At the end of November, the team goes out to Park City, UT to start winter training on snow.</p><p>Before he left for Utah, with a lot of emails and phone calls, Mike and Barb secured two equipment sponsors. Mike has received equipment from Dalbello Boots and Moment Skis.  Congratulations to Mike! This is a big acheivement for all of us - it means that someone besides us thinks that Mike has what it takes to get to the top!</p><p>In Park City, the team builds the jumps at the Utah Olympic Park, Mike's home base for the last 2 years, and start jumping on snow.  Three weeks of training on snow and it's off to Apex British Columbia, for the first NorAmï¿½competitions. The team gets a few days of practice at the jump site before the competitions are held.</p><p>The NorAms (short for North Americans) are international comps, one level below the World Cup, The athletes participating in the NorAms jump doubles and triples, Mike is jumping doubles, so many of the athletes are performing jumps with a higher degree of difficulty than Mike's.</p><p>Saturday Dec. 18 2010 The first NorAm competition, Mike jumped well enough to get 9th place.</p><p>Sunday Dec. 19, 2010, Another NorAm competition at the same location.  Mike finished in 3rd place, giving him his second NorAm podium finish.  As you may recall, Mike got 3rd last year in the first NorAm of the season.  Way to start the season Mike! And he was the only US guy to take home a medal at either event.</p><p>Mike is on his way home for the holidays, then it's back to Lake Placid and off to Mt Gabriel QC for another NorAm!"}
